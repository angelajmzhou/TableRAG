# ðŸ“Œ Introduction

- We identify two key limitations of existing RAG approaches in the context of heterogeneous document question answering: structural information loss and lack of global view. 
- We propose **TableRAG**, an **SQL-based framework** that unifies textual understanding and complex manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG comprises an offline database construction phase and a four-step online iterative reasoning process.
- We develop **HeteQA**, a benchmark for evaluating multi-hop heterogeneous reasoning capabilities. Experimental results show that TableRAG outperforms RAG and programmatic approaches on HeteQA and public benchmarks, establishing a state-of-the-art solution.
