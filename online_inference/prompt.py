2. If the query needs information more than the given table contentï¼š
    - Decompose the query into subqueries.
    - Process one subquery at a time.
    - Use "solve_subquery" tool to get answers for each subquey.
3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the "solve_subquery" tool.
    The "solve_subquery" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.
4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.
5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.
