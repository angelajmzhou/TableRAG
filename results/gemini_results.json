Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What year does Orson Scott Card 's 1986 novel take place ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: The novel *Speaker for the Dead* takes place around the year 5270, approximately 3,000 years after the events in *Ender's Game*.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: For the army that conflicted with the `` lashkars '' , what year did its soldier die ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided text, the conflict that involved fighting with 'lashkars' was the **Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948**, also known as the First Kashmir War.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What year did the university attended by Kentwan Balmer first start ending the practice of racially segregating students ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: The University of North Carolina began the process of desegregation in 1951 when African-American graduate students were admitted."}]}

If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: Who sponsors the distribution that is in-progress and using binary blobs ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Fedora"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, I am unable to answer the question \"Who sponsors Fedora?\".

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: How many boroughs does the 10th most populated metro area have ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided text, the New York metropolitan area is the tenth largest urban agglomeration in the world."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided content, New York City consists of five boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island."}]}

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: The squash player that won the 2019 CIB Egyptian Tour had previously won the Under-15 British Junior Open Squash title the same year the Under-19 title winner was a player that would go on to win a gold medal in what games ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, Marwan Tarek won the 2019 CIB Egyptian Tour professional tournament."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, Velavan Senthilkumar won a gold medal in the British Junior Open Squash in 2017."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, Velavan Senthilkumar won a gold medal in the 2017 British Junior Open Squash."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, Velavan Senthilkumar won a gold medal in the British Junior Open Squash in 2017."}]}

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What was the major education bill of the president who appointed Gale Norton ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, there is no mention of who appointed Gale Norton.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: Along what river is the town that the route which was redesignated as Leeds and Grenville County Road 32 goes to located ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the information provided, I am unable to answer your question.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What is the team for the racer who was brought in to replace fellow Italian Jarno Trulli ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, the racer who was on the same team as Jarno Trulli was Ralf Schumacher."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, there is no mention of an Italian driver who replaced Jarno Trulli.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

August 19 , 1971   | Santa Martha Acatitla                                      | Mexico         | Yes         | Joel David Kaplan Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro                  | Joel David Kaplan was a New York businessman and nephew of molasses tycoon Jacob Merrill Kaplan . The elder Kaplan earned his fortune primarily through operations in Cuba and the Dominican Republic . The J.M . Kaplan Fund ( named after the elder of the two ) was found in a 1964 Congressional investigation to be a conduit for funneling CIA money to Latin America , including through the Institute of International Research headed by Norman Thomas , six-time Presidential candidate for the Socialist Party of America . In May 1961 , the ruler of the Dominican Republic , Rafael Trujillo was murdered with weapons supplied by the CIA . The CIA described its role in changing the government of the Dominican Republic as a 'success ' in that it assisted in moving the Dominican Republic from a totalitarian dictatorship to a Western-style democracy . In November 1961 , Mexican police found a corpse they identified as Luis Melchior Vidal , Jr. , godson of Trujillo . Vidal was the unofficial business agent of the Dominican Republic while Trujillo was in power . Under cover of the American Sucrose Company and the Paint Company of America , Vidal had teamed up with the American , Joel David Kaplan , to operate as arms merchants for the CIA . In 1962 , the younger Kaplan was convicted of killing Vidal , in Mexico City . Kaplan was held at the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in the Iztapalapa borough of the Mexico City D.F . region . Joel 's sister , Judy Kaplan , attempted to secure his release in numerous ways , finally developing an audacious plot . On August 19 , 1971 , a helicopter landed in the prison yard . The guards mistakenly thought this was an official visit . In two minutes , Kaplan and Kaplan 's cellmate Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro , a Venezuelan counterfeiter , boarded the craft and were piloted away . No shots were fired . Both men were flown to Texas and then different planes flew Kaplan to California and Castro to Guatemala . The Mexican government never initiated extradition proceedings against Kaplan . The escape is told in a book , The 10-Second Jailbreak : The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan . It also inspired the 1975 action movie Breakout , which starred Charles Bronson and Robert Duvall |\n| October 31 , 1973  | Mountjoy Jail                                              | Ireland        | Yes         | JB O'Hagan Seamus Twomey Kevin Mallon                              | On October 31 , 1973 an IRA member hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to land in the exercise yard of Dublin 's Mountjoy Jail 's D Wing at 3:40 p.m. , October 31 , 1973 . Three members of the IRA were able to escape : JB O'Hagan , Seamus Twomey and Kevin Mallon . Another prisoner who also was in the prison was quoted as saying , One shamefaced screw apologised to the governor and said he thought it was the new Minister for Defence ( Paddy Donegan ) arriving . I told him it was our Minister of Defence leaving . The Mountjoy helicopter escape became Republican lore and was immortalized by The Helicopter Song , which contains the lines It 's up like a bird and over the city .

She demanded that he land in the Orsainville prison courtyard , where her boyfriend ( awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge ) was set to escape . The pilot , Brian Jenner , feigned a panic attack , put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet , in the back seat of the Jet Ranger , to turn over her shotgun and her knife . Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot , except the prison . She chose to go back to the airport . The pilot then explained , in great detail , exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport . He added that the police would surely be aware by then , that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot . All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details .

The three , all held on drug-importation charges , had hired a former SAS soldier , then living in the Philippines , to lift the prisoners from the jails tennis court to a nearby van fitted with panels to hide them for the 600 kilometre road trip to Sydney , where a yacht was to take them to Manila . The plan was thwarted when Lord Tony Moynihan , himself an exile in the Philippines , informed the Australian Federal Police , who then ran it as a sting operation . Tony Moynihan would later become an informer against Howard Marks in a Florida trial . Of the accused , only David McMillan and his accountant friend who had visited the prison stood trial . During the hearings , few prosecution witnesses used their real names as they were mostly from Moynihans former West African MI6 unit .

Both were later caught on November 15 when they arrived to pick up wedding rings from a California shopping mall . The authorities were monitoring the account McIntosh used to write the check and the police were waiting for them . Ron McIntosh for his role in the escape was sentenced to 25 years in prison .

The pilot hovered the helicopter three feet off the courtyard ground while around 50 inmates were exercising . While the hijackers laid covering fire , three inmates tried to board the helicopter . One escapee , Andre Bellaiche , 36 , was a Tunisian-born Frenchman who was in jail for murder and bank robbery . The other escapee , Gianluigi Esposito , 30 , was an arms smuggler accused of providing weapons to Italian terrorists . The third man , Luciano Cipollari , 24 , an Italian extradited from France in 1985 for murder , slipped and fell preventing him from escaping . The helicopter flew to a nearby soccer field scattering an ongoing game . The men ran out of the helicopter and hijacked a car to escape . They later managed to flee Italy , but police was able to track them down and they were both arrested again on 13 13 , 1986 . Esposito later revealed that he had intentionally prevented Cipollari from boarding , because he was just 2 years away from being released                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| December 10 , 1987 | Gartree ( HM Prison )                                      | United Kingdom | Yes         | Sydney Draper John Kendall                                         | At 3:16 p.m. on December 10 , 1987 , John Kendall and Sydney Draper were sprung from Gartree 's exercise yard with the aid of a hijacked Bell 206L helicopter .

The escape failed when the rookie pilot , Charles Clayton Stevens , hovered 12 inches off the ground in a very tight space ( 200'long by 50 ' wide ) . When the 6'-2 , 240 lb Kramer jumped into the small two seater Bell 47 D-1 ( trainer ) , its rear rotor struck the razor wire , causing it to be uncontrollable .

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What was the name of the prisoner who escape from Rio Piedras State Penitentiary in Puerto Rico ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: William Lane"}]}

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What is the capacity of the stadium that was completed in March 1999 at a cost of A $ 690 million ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided content, the stadium that was completed in March 1999 at a cost of A$690 million is Stadium Australia."}]}

The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor , which has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period . After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century , William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset . A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century . At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family , who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century . The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following a siege at the end of the English Civil War . In the 1860s and 1870s , the architect Anthony Salvin was employed to remodel the castle to fit Victorian tastes . Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944 , the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate and sold the castle and surrounding lands . The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954 , but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave it and most of its contents to the National Trust |\n| Dunster Working Watermill          | c. 1780       | -                   | II                      | Dunster 51\u00b010\u203257\u2033N 3\u00b026\u203245\u2033W / 51.1825\u00b0N 3.4459\u00b0W / 51.1825 ; -3.4459 ( Dunster Castle )                       | The Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , in the grounds of Dunster Castle .

It was saved from probable destruction thanks to a Miss Ripley , who bought it and bequeathed it to the National Trust , which undertook the works necessary to make it fit for visitors . In overhauling the structure of the premises in 1971 , the National Trust restored its medieval character by recreating on the ground floor the appearance of arcaded stalls opening onto the street , and the sixteenth-century decoration of the upstairs windows . The property is run as a local history museum by Axbridge and District Museum Trust with support from Somerset County Museums Service and Axbridge Archaeological and Local History Society                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: Which bridge spans the river that is the lower 12 miles ( 19 km ) of Washington state 's Green River ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided content, the lower 12 miles of Washington state's Green River is named the **Duwamish River**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: The bridges that span the Duwamish River are the First Avenue South Bridge, the Jeanette Williams Memorial Bridge (West Seattle Bridge), and the Spokane Street Bridge."}]}

This refers to the NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player award.\n    *   **Entity 2:** A \"first round draft selection of the Portland Trailblazers\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** The draft occurred in \"1978\".\n    *   **Goal:** Find the person who satisfies all these conditions.\n\n2.  **Examine the Provided Data:** I look at the `Gatorade_Player_of_the_Year_awards_3` table.\n    *   **Award:** The table is for the \"Gatorade Player of the Year\", not the \"Most Outstanding Player\". These are different awards.\n    *   **Timeframe:** The table data starts in 1986, which is eight years after the 1978 draft mentioned in the query.\n    *   **Content:** The table contains no information about NBA drafts, draft picks, or teams.\n\n3.  **Assess Data Sufficiency:** Based on the analysis, the provided table is completely insufficient to answer the user's query. It lacks the correct award information, the correct time period, and any draft-related data.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Decomposition Strategy:** According to the instructions, if the information is not in the table, I must decompose the query into subqueries and use the `solve_subquery` tool. My goal is to find the answer by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable pieces. I can approach this in two ways:\n    *   **Path A:** First, find the Most Outstanding Player for the relevant year(s), and then check if that person was drafted by the Trailblazers in 1978.\n    *   **Path B:** First, find who the Trailblazers drafted in the first round in 1978, and then check if that person was ever a Most Outstanding Player.\n\n    Path B seems slightly more direct, as it starts with a very specific and unique fact (a team's first-round pick in a given year).\n\n5.  **Construct the First Subquery:** Following Path B, the first logical question to ask is to identify the player drafted by the Trailblazers. This leads me to formulate the subquery: \"Who was the Portland Trailblazers' first-round draft pick in 1978?\".\n\n6.  **Review Provided \"Subquery Answer\" Context:** The prompt includes three identical \"Subquery Answer\" blocks that state the question cannot be answered from the \"provided materials\". This confirms my assessment that the table is useless. It also signals that the `solve_subquery` tool, when limited to just the table, will fail. However, the instructions explicitly tell me to use the tool for information *not* in the table, implying the tool has broader capabilities. Therefore, I should proceed with my subquery, as it is a necessary step to gather the required external information. The provided failure messages serve as justification for *why* I need to decompose and use the tool in the first place.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures I have correctly identified the information gap and have formulated a precise, necessary subquery to begin solving the user's complex question."]}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided materials, I am unable to answer the question.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What is the net worth of the Governor of the state that was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: West Virginia"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: The net worth of the Governor of West Virginia is $1.59 billion."}]}

This chapel was followed by a first church in 829 and later by a pre-Romanesque church on 899 , gradually becoming an important place of pilgrimage . In 997 this primitive church was reduced to ashes by Almanzor , commander of the army of the Caliphate of Cordoba . The construction of the current cathedral in the same place was built between 1075 and 1122 under the reign of Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile .

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: When did the team with the second most games played change the spelling of their name ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Boston Bruins"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, there is no indication that the Boston Bruins have ever changed their name.

If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: Which route connects , the freeway begins at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie and the highway that was established in 1937 due to rerouting of Highway 9 ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided text, the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) begins at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, the SQL query did not return any results.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: Who is the daughter of the directer of the Argentinian film ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Eliseo Subiela is the director of the Argentinian film."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, the daughter of Eliseo Subiela is Guadalupe Subiela.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: What is the name of the racecourse whose location was recognized by the Queen in 1957 because of the presence of Windsor Castle ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "model", "content": ["I need to find the name of a racecourse based on a specific historical fact about its location.\nFirst, I need to identify the location that was recognized by the Queen in 1957 because of the presence of Windsor Castle.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.

Both India and Pakistan claim the former independent princely state of Jammu and Kashmir , leading to the Indo-Pakistani war of 1947 . A UN-mediated ceasefire put a halt to the conflict in January 1949 . The UN resolution called for both the countries to demilitarise the region , following which a plebiscite would be held .

Following the latter war , the countries reached the Simla Agreement , agreeing on a Line of Control between their respective regions and committing to a peaceful resolution of the dispute through bilateral negotiations . An armed insurgency broke out in 1989 in the Indian administered part of Kashmir , demanding independence .

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: Which team won their 2nd MVC Tournament title against Indiana State ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: Based on the provided information, there is no team that won their 2nd MVC Tournament title against Indiana State.

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: How many beds are available in the city named after the only U.S .

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: How many seats is the twin turboprop transport/passenger aircraft designed in 1957 manufactured by the company that works closely with a turbine manufacturer located in Zaporizhia ?\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subquery Answer: The Antonov An-24 is a 44-seat twin turboprop transport/passenger aircraft designed in 1957 in the Soviet Union by the Antonov Design Bureau."}]}

Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquery.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6.
