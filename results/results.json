Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.\n2. If the query needs information more than the given table content\uff1a\n    - Decompose the query into subqueries.\n    - Process one subquery at a time.\n    - Use \"solve_subquery\" tool to get answers for each subquey.\n3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the \"solve_subquery\" tool.\n    The \"solve_subquery\" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.\n4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.\n5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.\n6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:\n    <Answer>: [your complete response]\n\nUser Input Query: who won 2012 berlin marathon\nPlease start!\n"}, {"role": "model", "content": ["The query asks who won the 2012 Berlin Marathon.
